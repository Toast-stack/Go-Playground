# Project Documentation: Simple HTTP Server
## Overview
The Simple HTTP Server project is a beginner-level application written in Go that demonstrates foundational concepts for serving HTTP requests. This server responds to incoming requests with basic messages and supports additional functionality such as query parameters and routing.

## Key Features
1. **Request Handling**: Processes HTTP GET requests and sends dynamic responses based on user input.
2. **Routing**: Includes multiple routes, such as a root endpoint (`/`) and a custom route (`/about`).
3. **Dynamic Responses**: Allows query parameters for personalized responses, such as greeting a user by name.

## Code Example
Here’s the basic implementation of the HTTP server:
```Go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	// Define the handler function
	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		name := r.URL.Query().Get("name")
		if name == "" {
			name = "Guest"
		}
		// Respond with a simple message
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, %s! Welcome to your first Go HTTP server.", name)
	})

	// Define the handler function for About
	http.HandleFunc("/about", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Fprintln(w, "This is the About page of your HTTP server.")
	})

	// Start the HTTP server on port 8080
	fmt.Println("Starting server on http://localhost:8080...")
	if err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil); err != nil {
		// Log an error if the server fails to start
		fmt.Println("Error starting server:", err)
	}
}
```
## How It Works
1. The `http.HandleFunc` methoid associates routes (e.g., `/` or `/about`) with specific handler functions.
2. Handler functions process incoming HTTP requests (`r`) and send HTTP responses (`w`).
3. Query parameter are extracted using `r.UR:.Query().Get("name")`.
4. The `http.ListenAndServe` method starts the server, listening for incoming requests on port `8080`.

## Why This Project Is Important
1. **Introduction to Web Servers**: Provides hands-on experience with Go's `net/http` package and basic HTTP concepts.
2. **Practical Application**: Demonstrates how to handle HTTP requests, define routes, and personalize responses—essential skills for web development and security.
3. **Portfolio Value**: Shows your ability to create and manage simple web servers, which is a fundamental building block for REST APIs and other web-based applications.
4. **Expandability**: Lays the foundation for more complex projects, such as API development, authentication workflows, and threat monitoring systems.

## Potential Enhancements
1. Add support for JSON responses using the `encoding/json` package.
2. Implement logging for incoming requests and responses.
3. Create a simple REST API with endpoints for CRUD operations.
